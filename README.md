# Foundation Data Science 

**Foundation Data Science** introduces the essential mathematical and computational tools required for modern data analysis. The course covers fundamental topics such as data structures, algorithms, probability theory, statistics, and optimization. It also introduces core modeling techniques, including **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods**, used for sampling, inference, and probabilistic model evaluation.

A key component of the course is the evaluation of models, focusing on assessing model quality through appropriate metrics, diagnostic tools, and validation techniques. These foundations prepare students for more advanced subjects such as **machine learning, artificial intelligence, Bayesian methods, and large-scale data processing**.
